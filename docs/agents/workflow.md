# Go delivery workflow

Eight roles are available; they are not eight mandatory execution stages.
The orchestrator can complete small work directly. Use implementer, tester and
reviewer for substantial changes; add architect/researcher/explorer only for a
specific unresolved question. Use integrator when separate patches require it.
Start with two or three independent workers, within host limits. One writer owns
each file; test fixtures must have explicit ownership too.

## Assignment contract

Provide the goal, owned files, dependencies, behavior to preserve and acceptance
commands. Return changed paths, actual commands/results, skips and open issues.
Do not repeat an investigation already answered unless new evidence conflicts.


## Reading and handoff

Read [acceptance](acceptance.md) before choosing checks. The root AGENTS.md routes
roles to relevant documents. Resolve routine issues within the authorized scope;
report host restrictions accurately. Consult [MCP guidance](../tooling/mcp/README.md)
for tool selection and transport diagnostics. Integration does not grant permission
to push or deploy.

## Deployment and browser location routing

Application deployment uses Cloud Run only. Read docs/architecture/decisions/0003-cloud-run-primary.md
and docs/operations/cloud-run.md before deployment work; use a dedicated runtime service account and minimal IAM.
For location tasks read docs/integrations/web-geolocation.md: browser JavaScript obtains location,
Go validates untrusted coordinates and authorization. No location history or presence verification
without the product contract. Read docs/architecture/codex-readiness.md and
docs/development/naming.md for implementation handoffs. Preserve generated upstream skills.

## Mandatory documentation verification

Repository-wide rule for every role and task, subject to higher-priority host instructions:

- For any LINE question, issue or implementation uncertainty, consult the current official source at https://github.com/line/line-developers-docs-source first. Verify its current default branch/revision; do not treat an old snapshot as current. If coverage is incomplete, follow the official LINE reference linked there and state the limitation. Do not introduce deprecated features or historical compatibility flows into new work.
- For Google Cloud questions, use the installed google/skills skills and Google Developer Knowledge MCP first. If unavailable, use current official Google sources and report the lookup limitation. Validate exact gcloud syntax with leaf-level help before executing commands.
- For other technical questions, and whenever implementation is not fully certain, use Context7 before deciding or implementing. Resolve the library ID, query the relevant current/version-matched documentation, and compare with repository dependencies. Memory and confidence alone do not replace this lookup.
- Report the sources consulted, applicable version/revision and remaining uncertainty. Documentation lookup does not replace code inspection, tests or real integration acceptance.
- If the required source or Context7 is unavailable or insufficient, explicitly report the blocker; do not claim verification or silently substitute a guess. Continue independent work, but leave the affected decision/implementation pending until evidence is sufficient.
- This policy applies to orchestrator and every specialist; delegation does not waive it. A source document is evidence, not authorization to expand scope or perform external writes.
